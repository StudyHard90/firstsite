				<p>Martin is one fun-loving and friendly boy as you can clearly see. Considering his past, this is really quite remarkable. He was saved just in time from a market where the ‘homeless’ dogs were being poisoned.

Before this, he had been mistreated as many street dogs are, leaving him with a jaw that doesn’t fully open and susceptible to attacks from other dogs as he could not defend himself. His final setback came when he was struck by a car that led to a serious leg injury. This boy has really been through some tough times and has shown perseverance — and a heart of gold.

Now healed and ready to embark on his new journey with a hopeful outlook, Martin’s wish is for a kind-hearted owner to share in mutual respect and the simple pleasures that life can bring.

He is a young, good-looking Thai ridgeback mix, and a very playful boy. And to top it off, Martin has an absolutely delightful personality and makes friends very easily. He hopes his future will bring much joy, affection and loads of activity. Please come meet Martin and see for yourself what a genuinely sweet and gentle boy he truly is!</p>
